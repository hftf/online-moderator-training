	<li><p>If a technical issue prevents one player from hearing/answering questions, first finish the tossup/bonus cycle (unless both teams agree to an ad-hoc solution). Moderators are not responsible for players’ faulty equipment.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>After the tossup/bonus cycle, wait briefly if the player is still experiencing light issues (e.g., if they need to disconnect and reconnect), but then move on.</p></li>
			<li><p>Technical issues are not protestable.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>If a technical issue prevents you from reading questions or hearing players’ responses, and you have a scorekeeper, ask your scorekeeper if they are comfortable moderating while you troubleshoot the issue.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>If you do not have a scorekeeper, you can still try to <a href="http://www.pace-nsc.org/online-tournament-guide/players/troubleshooting-discord-technical-issues/">troubleshoot the problem yourself</a>, but don’t hold up the game indefinitely. <a href="how-to-report.php">Report the problem to the TD or control room</a> and see if you can be replaced.</p></li>
