	<li><p>Expectations for ethics and conduct are outlined in <a href="https://acf-quizbowl.com/gameplay-rules/#i-ethics-and-conduct">Section <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size-adjust: 0.54;">I</span> of ACF’s rules</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Serious concerns about cheating and misconduct are important enough to pause the game for. Say something like “Sorry, I’m needed in the control room. Please bear with me for a moment, we’ll unpause the game ASAP.” Then take a note of the incident and <a href="how-to-report.php">report it to the TD</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you have a scorekeeper, they can take over while you step out to report the incident. Alternatively, they can report it while you continue the game.</p></li>
	<li><p>Enforce misconduct rules during games, especially for cases of aggression, inappropriate comments, disruptive behavior, etc. Simply saying “please stop doing that” or “this behavior is not acceptable” can make a big difference. You can also warn players that you will <a href="how-to-report.php">alert the TD</a> if the behavior continues.</p></li>
	<li><p>If players continue to be disruptive or inappropriate after your warnings, <a href="how-to-report.php">report it to the TD</a> during or after the round.</p></li>
