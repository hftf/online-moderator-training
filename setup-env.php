<p>Setting up your environment is one of the most important components of being an effective moderator, both online and in-person. This section includes advice for setting up both your physical space and your computer.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Use a headset. Sit in a quiet environment. Close unnecessary programs that can slow down your computer, as video calling is resource-intensive.</p></li>
	<li><p><a href="testing.php">Test your equipment in advance</a>, and adjust settings as needed. You can do this with a friend over whichever platform you will be using, or you can do it on your own.</p></li>
	<li><p>Always keep water handy. Prepare a simple meal that is ready to eat when your lunch break starts. Avoid eating during or between matches; this can make it difficult to speak at length.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you live with others, inform them of your commitment ahead of time and ask them to minimize ambient noise and distractions.</p></li>
</ol>
