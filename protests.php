<ul>
	<li><p>If a team protests, you or your scorekeeper should quickly take note in the scoresheet of what is being protested (in general terms) and how the score would change if the protest were upheld.</p></li>
	<li><p>You are not responsible for resolving protests, so don’t get into a long debate with players about whether a protest is right or wrong. Note the protest in the scoresheet and move on.</p></li>
	<li><p>At the end of the game, if any protest could change the game result, gather any needed additional information about the protests from the teams and officially report it to the TD. Since protests must be judged fairly, do not reveal which teams or players are involved.</p></li>
	<li><p>ACF’s rules concerning protests are available <a href="https://acf-quizbowl.com/gameplay-rules/#h-protests">here</a>. Depending on the tournament rules, some issues are not protestable, including moderator judgment. If you’re not sure if something is protestable, just mark a protest anyway, move on, and let the TD make the final determination. Trying to litigate whether or not something is protestable delays the match and, potentially, the whole tournament.</p></li>
