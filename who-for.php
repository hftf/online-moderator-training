<p>This guide assumes you <mark>already have some experience</mark> with quizbowl and moderating quizbowl in person, so it doesn’t cover the basics. It is most useful to people looking to improve their existing moderating skills to prepare for online tournaments.</p>

<p>This guide <mark>is not meant to be an introduction</mark> for people with zero experience with quizbowl or moderating quizbowl tournaments. However, you may still find this training helpful. Keep in mind that first-time staff usually start out scorekeeping instead of moderating. If you would like to help staff a quizbowl tournament, but feel like you do not have enough experience to moderate, reach out to the TD and ask how else you can contribute.</p>

<p>Moderators for ACF’s online tournaments are expected to complete this training. Other guides or training modules are not acceptable substitutes.</p>
