<ul>
	<li><p>If a team protests, you or your scorekeeper should <mark>quickly take note in the scoresheet</mark> of what is being protested (in general terms) and how the score would change if the protest were upheld.</p></li>
	<li><p><mark>You are not responsible for resolving protests</mark>, so don’t get into a long debate with players about whether a protest is right or wrong. Note the protest in the scoresheet and move on.</p></li>
	<li><p>At the end of the game, if any protest could change the game result, gather any needed additional information about the protests from the teams and <a href="how-to-report.php">officially report it to the TD</a>. Since protests must be judged fairly and anonymously, <mark>do not reveal which teams or players are involved</mark>.</p></li>
	<li><p>ACF’s rules concerning protests are available <a href="https://acf-quizbowl.com/gameplay-rules/#h-protests">here</a>. Depending on the tournament rules, some issues are not protestable, including moderator judgment. If you’re not sure if something is protestable, just mark a protest anyway, move on, and let the TD make the final determination. Trying to litigate whether or not something is protestable delays the match and, potentially, the whole tournament.</p></li>
