	<li><p>If you’re unsure how to pronounce a word, <mark>pronounce it phonetically</mark> and move on. Don’t go back to fix it, unless you think your first pronunciation was actively misleading and that you can fix it in one more try.</p></li>
	<li><p>Many readers find that when reading for online tournaments, they talk louder and tire out their voice more. Players should be able to hear you fine even if you speak at a comfortable, conversational volume, especially if you use a headset.</p></li>
