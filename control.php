<ul>
	<li><p>As the moderator, <mark>you are the official decision-maker</mark> for the match and your decisions should be respected. You are responsible for controlling the pace of the game and promoting an atmosphere of professionalism and respect for everyone. You should project confidence and authority to the best of your ability. You can always ask your TD for backup if you need help.</p></li>
	<li><p><mark>Minimize casual discussion</mark> between questions. For example, don’t let teams talk during other teams’ bonuses. Online tournaments take a long time, and extensive talk between questions may lead to long delays.</p></li>
	<li><p>When you finish a question, <mark>go on to the next one</mark> as promptly as possible. If players start talking, don’t wait for them to stop; get their attention by announcing the next question loudly and start reading anyway. They will likely stop talking once they realize they’re missing gameplay.</p></li>
	<li><p>It’s okay to be friendly with teams before or after games, assuming time permits, but try to <mark>engage equally</mark> with all teams. Avoid the appearance of favoritism toward specific players/teams/schools you might be more familiar with.</p></li>
